# FOAR705 Proof-of-Concept
## Emily Hunt

This proof-of-concept technology deployment was undertaken to assist in the completion of my Master of Research thesis at Macquarie University, of which a fundamental aspect will be the analysis of animated films.

The project was developed through a number of stages, all of which are briefly outlined in the sections below.

While it underwent many changes throughout its creation, a constant theme was the issues I have organising the notes I take when watching a film.

This concern informed my final project, as it appears below, which primarily targets the creation stage of the data life cycle. I have deployed a jekyll based site, complied with npm, of the open source transcription software oTranscribe. While intended for the transcription of audio/visual sources, this software proved to be ideal for my purposes in allowing the creation of notes while watching a video file that include a timestamp that can be selected to take you to that point in the video. Running this site myself through GitHub allows me to assure the tool will be available throughout the duration of the completion of my thesis, ensuring my research will not be disrupted by external factors where possible (e.g. the removal of the oTranscribe website).

Additionally,  . . . . .

Every technical step I took in the completion of this project is detailed in my [Learning Journal](https://github.com/MQ-FOAR705/Hunt-Learning-Journal/tree/850c1b6e3e7da90878e6e5c957679a0df5459534), which also includes other activities undertaken for the unit for which this project was completed, FOAR705 Digital Humanities.


Please Note: As opposed https://readthedocs.org/, I have hosted this static site on GitHub, as that is what I am running my proof-of-concept on.

### PROCESS

### Scoping
[Scoping Exercise 1](https://github.com/MQ-FOAR705/Hunt-Exercises/blob/master/Hunt-Scoping%20Exercise.pdf)
<br />
Firstly, a preliminary scoping exercise was intended to allow me to identify the problems I typically encounter during all stages of research (pains) and aspects of my current approaches which I could improve (gains). One specific gain I recognised that formed the basis of my final project was that it would be really useful if I had a tool that was able to link notes to a specific frame of a film. This addressed the issues with my current time consuming approach of taking rough notes (frequently without a timestamp) and then having to scrub through a film to determine which part of it I was referencing in a note.

[Scoping Exercise 2](https://github.com/MQ-FOAR705/Hunt_Scoping_2_Computational_Analysis/tree/d31da158e86a974e494cdc4516c974fbd745eae4)
<br />
In the second scoping exercise, a computational anaylsis was completed on select pain relievers/gain creators. While my final version of this document focused on a gain creator related to quantitatively analysing the colours present in a film (a notetaking gain creator was discussed in an earlier version), my final project will allow me to more clearly organise my observations on all aspects of a film, including colour.

### Elaboration and Design
[Elaboration Planning](https://github.com/MQ-FOAR705/Hunt_Elaboration_1_Planning/tree/d4199f3bb947796168a9ffd85e2ab1cd65c21b86)
<br />
[Elaboration Testing](https://github.com/MQ-FOAR705/Hunt_Elaboration_2_Testing/tree/2fd260c520b51e7a68835084fe2e7d769016efa2)<br />
[Proof Of Concept Design Document](https://github.com/MQ-FOAR705/Hunt_Proof_Of_Concept_Design/tree/628f2cc3c2499c57512d2e432345cd18178d629a)

Elaboration planning involved finding some tools which could potentially relieve the pains or create the gains I had selected, with these then Tested in elaboration testing.

In relation to note taking, I identified the app ClipNotes in elaboration, which in my Design document I expressed the intention to use with a script analysis software, ScriptThreads. 

However, after discussions with the unit's teaching staff, I refrained from using these tools for my final project for a number of reasons. Firstly, the use of proprietary software, particularly applications from the Apple App Store (ClipNotes) could create future issues for me if I used them, as they could be removed from the store without notice and without support. Secondly, I was making my aims fit with the capabilities of the software I found, rather than the other way around. For example, ClipNotes required the creation of notes in an xml file, which then had to be imported into the app in order for them to be viewed with a film, as opposed to allowing you to take notes while watching a video which was what I wanted to do.

I was advised to look for software that was perhaps not specifically designed for what I was trying to do, but could be harnessed succcessfully for my purposes. Consequently, I found oTranscribe, which addressed both of the issues I had with the other tools I had found and formed the basis of my final project.

#### Instructions

#### License

### Acceptibilty Criteria
Using oTranscribe, you should be able to:
* criteria 1
* criteria 2
<br />
Using the Unix Script, you should be able to:
* criteria 1
* criteria 2
<br />
<br />
As a result of the number of changes this project underwent, these acceptibility criteria differ from those initialy proposed in the Proof of Design Document referenced earlier.

description: |-
  This project was created to attempt to alleviate some of the pains associated with research involving the analysis of films, which I will be undertaking in the completion of my Master of Research. The project was completed as one aspect of the FOAR705 Digital Humanities unit at Macquarie University.

  This Unix Script is designed to take a plain text file containing notes created in the oTranscribe web application, and sort these notes into separate text files on the basis of their mention of specific keywords.

  For more information about this project and deployment instructions please see https://mq-foar705.github.io/Hunt-Exercises/.
